# RGBT-PEDE
RGBT-PEDE is the first publicly available dataset designed for text-based RGBT person retrieval. It contains 1,822 unique identities, multi-modal images (RGB and thermal), and fine-grained textual descriptions. The dataset covers a wide range of scenes across daytime and nighttime, featuring various challenges such as occlusion and illumination changes.
